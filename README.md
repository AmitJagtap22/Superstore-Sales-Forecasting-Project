# Superstore-Sales-Forecasting-Project

Problem Statement:
A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country is facing issues in managing the inventory. To match the demand with respect to supply, they would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. Here historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions is available. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times, due to the unsuitable machine learning algorithm and forecasting model. An ideal ML algorithm and forecasting model will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.
